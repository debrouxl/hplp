hplp: code for communicating with recent HP calculators
=======================================================

hplp (still entirely in libhpcalcs for now) is the beginning of a toolkit for
two-way communications with HP Prime calculators.

See below for detailed build instructions. Note that
the install_hplp.sh script provided alongside this README
( https://raw.github.com/debrouxl/hplp/master/install_hplp.sh )
automates part of the build process.


Status (2014/06/03)
-------------------
The code base does:
* work on Windows, Linux and MacOS X;
* support communication with a single Prime calculator connected to the
  computer. The communication is known to work with the following firmware
  versions, but might not work with other older or newer versions, if HP
  performs backwards-incompatible changes in the protocol (like TI does):
  * "SDKV0.30" firmware version from mid-August 2013;
  * "SDKV0.32" build 5447 firmware version from late November 2013;
  * partial success with the V0.031.6030 / V0.032.6030 build 6030 firmware
    versions published late May 2013.
* implement 10 operations (without _known_ bugs):
  * ready check;
  * get calculator information;
  * set date and time;
  * receive screenshot;
  * send file (for now, the leading metadata of *.hpprgm, if any, needs to be
    stripped manually);
  * receive file;
  * receive backup;
  * send key(s) (remote control);
  * send chat;
  * receive chat;
* provide a terminal-based UI: the test program "test_hpcalcs".

The code base doesn't:
* perform color conversion on PNG screenshots (libhpcalcs should use libpng to
  uncompress the files, mangle pixels, and recompress to PNG);
* provide a user-friendly GUI for the above, but a GUI can definitely build
  upon the library easily enough;
* implement _proper_ conversion from UTF-16 LE to other charsets on its own:
  that's a task for libicu, Qt or other libraries.


Goals
-----
Laying the groundwork for GUIs dealing with two-way communication with HP
Prime calculators, and possibly 39gII (Prime and 39gII are similar), using
USB HID class, and possibly later fake MSD for firmware upgrades.


Non-goals
---------
As far as I'm concerned, working _by myself_ on:
* duplicating / replacing code targeting older, non-USB HID-based HP
  calculators;
* a GUI comparable to HP's Connectivity Kit. However, other people should
  obviously do it, in order to make the software much more usable !


Build process summary
---------------------
As mentioned above, the repository contains an script for automating the
part of the build strictly related to libhpcalcs / hplp: install_hplp.sh .

The build process is that of pretty much any autotools-based piece of
software:
$ autoreconf -i -f
$ ./configure
$ ./make check
# make install

The terminal-based test program is in tests/test_hpcalcs.

For now, the main external dependency of libhpcalcs is HIDAPI:
https://github.com/signal11/hidapi.git
Unless your Linux distro packages it (few do), you need to compile and
install it yourself (it is also an autotools-based project: configure,
make, make install).


Detailed build & configuration process for Debian, Ubuntu, Mint and derivatives

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Install build dependencies (packages required for building libhpcalcs).
As root (with root shell, or sudo)
# (sudo) apt-get install build-essential git autoconf automake autopoint libtool gettext xdg-utils libpng-dev libudev-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev autotools-dev

2. Install hidapi:

$ mkdir -p $HOME/lpg # or anywhere else you see fit
$ cd $HOME/lpg
$ git clone https://github.com/signal11/hidapi.git hidapi
$ cd hidapi

Follow the directions from the README.txt file:

$ ./bootstrap
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr
$ make

As root (with root shell, or sudo):
# (sudo) make install     <----- as root, or using sudo

3. Install libhpcalcs

Download
https://raw.github.com/debrouxl/hplp/master/install_hplp.sh
and copy it to, for instance, $HOME/hplp

$ cd $HOME/lpg
$ chmod +x install_hplp.sh
# (sudo) ./install_hplp.sh

4. Test hplp

As root, verify that you can run test_hpcalcs.
Plug in your HP Prime to the computer and turn it on.
Wait about 10 seconds and then run:

$ $HOME/lpg/hplp/libhpcalcs/tests/test_hpcalcs

You should see the menu of possible operations.
If you do, hplp is working and you are successfully communicating with your Prime.

5. Set up for normal users to access the Prime with the test software.

   a. If you are on your own isolated computer (e.g, laptop),
      then add the following udev rules to the new file
      /etc/udev/rules.d/82-hp-prime.rules :

        # HP Prime Calculator
        SUBSYSTEM=="usb",  ATTRS{idVendor}=="03f0", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0441", MODE="0666"
        KERNEL=="hidraw*", ATTRS{idVendor}=="03f0", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0441", MODE="0666"

      Note that anyone on your system will be able to access your Prime with
      the hplp software.

      If you are on a shared system and you want to avoid anyone accessing the
      device but you, do this instead:

        # HP Prime Calculator
        SUBSYSTEM=="usb",  ATTRS{idVendor}=="03f0", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0441", ACTION=="add", GROUP="dialout", MODE="0664"
        KERNEL=="hidraw*", ATTRS{idVendor}=="03f0", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0441", ACTION=="add", GROUP="dialout", MODE="0664"

        and add yourself to the 'dialout' group.  You may need to switch to
        the new group for this to work (eg: newgrp dialout).

      To activate the new udev rule, turn off your HP Prime, turn it back on,
      and wait for about 10 seconds. Then, check the permissions for the device
      (in /dev/hidraw? and /dev/usb/hiddev?).


NOTES:
  * technically, compilation doesn't require being root, only the 'make install'
    commands for hidapi and libhpcalcs (embedded into install_hplp.sh) require
    root (and even then, only if installing to /usr or some root-only location).
    install_hplp.sh cannot use sudo on its own, as it's not necessarily
    configured by default.
  * in the above directions, the source location to be $HOME/lpg. You may prefer
    some other location, just replace $HOME/lpg by your location.
  * the install prefix is forced to /usr, so that you don't have to adjust the
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable, or add a line in /etc/ld.so.conf, or
    add a file in /etc/ld.so.conf.d.
    The install prefix is controlled by using the --prefix option to configure,
    for hidapi and within install_hplp.sh.


Technical notes
---------------
The code leverages HIDAPI, and it was strongly inspired by the time-proven
concepts and APIs of the libti* family, which I (Lionel Debroux) am the
current maintainer of.
The GPL'ed libti* family ( https://github.com/debrouxl/tilibs ) forms the
back-end for TILP, TIEmu, TilEm and titools (mainly), and contains the only
third-party portable FLOSS code with two-way communication support for all
three series of TI-Z80, TI-68k and TI-Nspire graphing calculators.
Putting together framework strongly inspired by libti* clearly took some work,
but having such a foundation saves time in the longer term. IOW, it's worth
the apparent complexity.

Obviously, until the calculator's protocol is better documented, the API
will change in backwards-incompatible manners (for instance, the output
parameters of check ready and get infos operations).


TODO list
---------
* ... hopefully attract _code_ contributors who have more free time than I do;
* a GUI, but I won't be the one doing it.
  Nowadays, Qt is the main choice for a portable, good-looking, fast UI
  toolkit (for native code programs). GTK+ used to be a better choice wrt.
  portability, but that was years ago, and in 2013-2015, a number of
  applications and desktop environments are switching from GTK+ to Qt.
  UIs based on Web technologies are another option, Qt provides support for
  those (QtWebkit / QtWebEngine) as well.
* strip out leading program metadata, if any, from .hpprgm files, like the
  UTF-16LE BOM is already stripped.
  Implementation notes:
  * in a loop, attempt to read 4 bytes containing size, and seek forward of
    that many bytes. If this leads the offset beyond EOF, break out.
* add some form of packet parsing + validation API, which can be used for
  both internal sanity checking and packet dissection;
* add 39gII support, probably, as the Prime is similar to the 39gII. That's
  where the usefulness of the cables / calcs separation and cables generic
  API will become most obvious.
  Implementation notes:
  * move the upper layer from prime_cmd into a new file called by both
    prime_cmd and the new file (like e.g. dusb_cmd in libticalcs).
  * the 39gII has 00 00 CRC.
* modify the way recv_backup works for more reliability.
  Implementation notes:
  * recv_backup should attempt to receive as much data as the calculator sends,
    and then split the received data. The main heuristic would be to assume
    that some packets were lost, and traverse backwards the contents of the
    current file to find a (00) F7 01 xx xx xx xx packet ? While this could
    fail in some circumstances, it should usually salvage more data.
  * recv_file shall probably be refactored as well;
  * Marcus Von Cube reported that when receiving a backup fails, the test
    program crashes:
"
hpcalcs INFO: prime_send_data: send remaining failed
hpcalcs ERROR: calc_prime_recv_backup: s_recv_backup failed
hpcalcs ERROR: hpcalcs_calc_recv_backup: recv_backup failed
hpfiles INFO: Displaying var entry 83EC8B55
hpfiles INFO: Name: 
"
* implement screenshot color conversion, with libpng;
* add progress feedback functionality, improved from libti*: the libti*
  implementation is too complex.
  Implementation notes:
  * can information for current chunk of the transfer + information for the
    transfer as a whole be passed through arguments of a single callback.
* add port number functionality, known from libticables, in the API. That
  will enable passthrough mode for communication between real and/or
  emulated calculators;
* fill in torture test;
* add two APIs for dynamically building NULL-terminated const char * arrays
  from the two first columns of typesprime.c::PRIME_CONST.
* somehow gain better knowledge of the protocol, so as to be able to...
* ... add more operations and data structures. 
* add dissectors and session logs, improved from libticables.
  Design goals:
  * make it possible to trace packet flow direction;
  * make it possible to validate (sanity check) packets , to begin with...
  Implementation notes:
  * new APIs for registering and unregistering (multiple) callbacks;
  * call the registered callbacks upon packet send and packet receive;
  * leverage the packet parsing / validation code.
* add support for Prime in fake MSD mode, for firmware upgrades ? I've
  already partially analyzed the protocol and published my notes at
  http://tiplanet.org/hpwiki/index.php?title=HP_Prime/Linking_Protocol
  but I'm not really confident about it ;)
  Need to find a library for MSD. libusb does not recommend using it
  in MSD mode.
* certainly more... at least, if users and programmers think the software
  fits a purpose :-)

Credits (demoscene style)
-------------------------
* _many_ thanks to Xavier "critor" Andréani for testing many program versions
  on his real Prime and providing many USB packet dumps (which I analyzed
  with Wireshark) and terminal output sessions;
* many thanks to Marcus Von Cube for providing USB packet dumps for the 39gII,
  which show that it's quite similar to the Prime;
* thanks to Jonathan Cameron for writing a more detailed build procedure for
  Debian and derivatives;
* thanks to other beta-testers who reported bugs on TI-Planet and MoHPC:
  * with the Prime: persalteas (Linux), wawachief (Linux & MacOS X), DJ
    Omnimaga (Windows), Adriweb (MacOS X & Windows), Jonathan Cameron (Linux),
    Cristian Arezzini (Linux), LarsF (MacOS X), Egan Ford (MacOS X);
  * with the 39gII: Marcus Von Cube;
* greetings to the other TI-Planet ( http://tiplanet.org/ ) admins;
* greetings to the HP Prime developer team at HP: some of its members spend
  time attending user message boards and interacting with users and programmers,
  even in communities traditionally interested in TI calcs (Omnimaga, Cemetech,
  TI-Planet), which is a win-win move for both HP and its users;
* fuck TI EdTech management imposing a closed-minded, lose-lose stance on the
  Nspire platform, despite repeated community input since 2007.
